I would highly suggest all of you to take a look at this wonderful repo which served as the inspiration for my project.

### Step 1: Clone the repo

Fork the repository. then clone the repo locally by doing -

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Varad924924/Face-Liveness-Detection-Real-or-Fake-

### Step 2: Create a virtual environment and activate it. (note: I have used pip)

```sh
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv [env-name]
[env-name]\Scripts\activate 
```

### Step 3: cd into the directory

```sh
cd Face-Liveness-Detection-Anti-Spoofing-Web-App
